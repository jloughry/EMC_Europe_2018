\section{Introduction}

Since the publication sixteen years ago of two papers on optical
\textsc{tempest}, open sources on security of compromising emanations, and
side channels in general, has exploded. Before 1996, only a handful of papers
had been published on the subject \cite{Smulders1990}, the most famous being
van Eck on RF emanations from CRT displays \cite{vanEck1985}. But following
Kocher's seminal 1996 paper on side channel attacks \cite{Kocher1996}---not
to forget earlier but less scientific reports \cite{Wright1987} dating back
a hundred years---two papers appeared within the same week on complementary
aspects of optical emanations \cite{Kuhn2002,Loughry2002a}.

footnote), LCD monitors.

The first part of this paper is a survey of further work done by others since
the publication of \cite{Loughry2002a} in 2002. This is followed by a
description of the design process for a new product according to these
principles.

\section{Design of a new product with optical \textsc{tempest} principles
in mind}

According to these hard-won principles.

\subsection{Simple photoconductive photodiode design}

The photodiode circuit is shown in Figure \ref{figure:photodiode_pullup}.
The photodiode operates in reverse bias (photoconductive) mode for two
reasons: speed, and simplicity of implementation. The same photodiode
operated in photovoltaic mode would be more sensitive to very low level
signals and have a lower dark current, but would require a transimpedance
amplifier for current-to-voltage conversion, which would make the design
more complicated and thereby more difficult to evaluate for security.

        for transparency of implementation; the \SI{10}{\kilo\ohm} pull-up
        resistor for reliability and a \SI{100}{\ohm} series resistor to
        protect the general-purpose IO (GPIO) pin from being shorted to
        ground in case it were accidentally set to output a HIGH logic level
        at the same time the photodiode was illuminated.}
