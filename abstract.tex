Research on optical TEMPEST has exploded since 2002 when the first papers
appeared from widely separated locations within a week of each other. In the
intervening time, vulnerabilities have evolved along with hardware, and
several new threat vectors have appeared. Although the supply chain ecosystem
of Ethernet has reduced the vulnerability of billions of devices through use
of standardised PHY chips, other recent trends including High Frequency
Trading (HFT) in the financial sector, the Internet of Things (IoT), and
inexpensive drones have made it relevant again.
