Research on optical TEMPEST has moved forward since 2002 when the first pair
of papers on the subject emerged independently and from widely separated
locations in the world within a week of each other. Since that time,
vulnerabilities have evolved along with systems, and several new threat
vectors have consequently appeared. Although the supply chain ecosystem of
Ethernet has reduced the vulnerability of billions of devices through use of
standardised PHY solutions, other recent trends including the Internet of
Things (IoT) in both industrial settings and the general population, High
Frequency Trading (HFT) in the financial sector, the European General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR), and inexpensive drones have made it relevant
again for consideration in the design of new products for privacy. One of the
general principles of security is that vulnerabilities, once fixed, sometimes
do not stay that way.
