Research on optical TEMPEST has exploded since 2002 when the first two papers
on the subject appeared from widely separated locations within a week of each
other. Since that time, vulnerabilities have evolved along with systems, and
several new threat vectors have consequently appeared. Although the supply
chain ecosystem of Ethernet has reduced the vulnerability of billions of
devices through use of standardised PHY solutions, other recent trends
including the Internet of Things (IoT) in both industrial settings and the
general population, High Frequency Trading (HFT) in the financial sector, the
European General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), and inexpensive drones
have made it relevant again. One of the general principles of security is
that vulnerabilities, once fixed, sometimes do not stay that way.
